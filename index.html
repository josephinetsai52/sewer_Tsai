    <h2> Computer Says "No" to Sewer Backups</h2>
        <h3> Bay Ridge residents report raw sewage flooding their homes, but DEP says it has no 311 data</h3>

        Raw sewage has flooded Regina Farage’s basement during heavy rainfalls at least three times since 2021. </p>

        <p> "I got raw sewage in my basement that was so disgusting, I was vomiting," Farage said.</p>


        <p> Farage lives on 72nd Street in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, where neighbors have also had their homes flooded.</p>

<p>Farage said she filed four insurance claims and now pays a $9,000 premium.</p>

<p>She said she reached out to City Councilman Justice Brannan’s office and was told there were no 311 data to support her claims. </p>

<p>Community Board 10, which represents Bay Ridge, invited Drisana Hughes, the Brooklyn Borough Commissioner of the New York City Department of Environmental Protection, to speak with residents about their sewer backup complaints.</p>

<p>At the Oct. 28 meeting, District Manager Josephine Beckmann said she had received 48 emails from residents about sewer backups.</p>

<p>Hughes said that most of Bay Ridge has a combined sewer system which carries both sanitary and storm water.</p>

<p>Hughes said she was not surprised by the sewer backup complaints given the frequency of intense storms, which can dump over two inches of rain per hour. New York City’s sewer system can handle up to 1.75 inches of rain per hour, according to the Department of Environmental Protection.</p>

<p>“Neighborhoods who do not call 311, from a data perspective, [are] disadvantaged," Hughes said. "We looked up 72nd Street between Narrows and Colonial. We have 17 311 [calls] from this block since 1999.”</p>

<p>Farage said that on July 31, her home flooded, and she called 311 four times. She said that the first three calls were unsuccessful, because the 311 operator lacked administrative access. </p>

<p>On the fourth attempt on Aug. 2, Farage said she was able to submit a 311 complaint and was told the department would respond in six hours. She has not heard back from the Department of Environmental Protection.</p>

<p>“It bothers me immensely that DEP and our politicians are relying on these 311 complaints, because I’ve always had problems with 311,” Farage said. “We’re telling you our complaints. We have pictures of our floods.”</p>


<iframe title="Annual percentage change of 311 calls from Brooklyn CB 10 for sewer backups due to excessive rain, 2013-2025" aria-label="Line chart" id="datawrapper-chart-nGbmX" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/nGbmX/6/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="500" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";r.style.height=d}}});</script>


<p> Although 311 data from individual neighborhoods were too small to analyze, the chart above shows a sustained positive percentage change in 311 calls from Community Board 10 from 2020 to the present, corresponding to the observations of Farage.</p>

<p> The percentage increase in 311 calls was nearly 40 percent in 2022. This year is on track to recording the second highest percentage change in 311 sewer backup calls since 2013. </p>

<p>Hughes declined to comment on the analyses. Department of Environmental Protection spokesperson, Douglas Auer, responded that these analyses highlight what New York City overall has been experiencing : an increase in sewer backup calls to 311 due to heavy rainfall.</p>

<p>"New York City has now been reclassified as a 'humid subtropical'," Auer wrote.

<p> Hughes said she initiated a sewer drainage study in Bay Ridge in October. She said a drainage study usually takes one year to complete, and a new sewer project will likely not start until late 2030s.</p>
